            <p begin="00:05.0" end="00:07.4">would see something very strange.</p>
            <p begin="00:07.4" end="00:10.5">It would seem as though the car itself were getting shorter</p>
            <p begin="00:10.5" end="00:14.4">and that time for the person in the car was slowing down.</p>
            <p begin="00:14.4" end="00:17.3">However, you wouldn't see these effects</p>
            <p begin="00:17.3" end="00:20.6">until the car began to approach the speed of light.</p>
            <p begin="00:20.6" end="00:23.0">At 90% of the speed of light</p>
            <p begin="00:23.0" end="00:28.6">the car would appear to shrink to 44% of its usual length.</p>
            <p begin="00:28.6" end="00:30.2">This thought experiment</p>
            <p begin="00:30.2" end="00:32.5">answered Einstein's old question</p>
            <p begin="00:32.5" end="00:33.9">about what he would see</p>
            <p begin="00:33.9" end="00:36.3">if he traveled along with a beam of light.</p>
            <p begin="00:36.3" end="00:38.4">He simply couldn't make the trip</p>
            <p begin="00:38.4" end="00:42.1">for at the speed of light, length would contract to zero</p>
            <p begin="00:42.1" end="00:44.5">and time would stop.</p>
